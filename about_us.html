            <p><strong>Connect Wellard</strong> is a community group formed to connect people together as well as computers to create both professional and physical networks.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Since 1st Aug 2018, we've met weekly on Wednesdays at the John Wellard Community Centre (JWCC).</p>
            <p>People are welcome to bring any ideas for new projects that enable people & our technology to collaborate & communicate, or just join us to work on a project to learn something new, or just talk people with similar interests.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The first projects we're making progress on in 2018 have been building infrastructure for community WiFi & IoT communication networks, together with hardware & software to use those networks. We've several WiFi access points, a LoRaWAN gateway, a few 'smart' sensors and DevKits to experiment with.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
            From <b>Arduino..<i>to</i>..Zigbee</b> there is many technologies our group will work together to learn, for fun and professional career development.<br />See our Projects page for info about work-in-progress & ideas that need people to work on them!

             Connect Wellard is a proud supporter of the Tech Tinkering event, to be held in JWCC on the last Saturday of each month, as a great opportunity to showcase to our local community what we're working on and encourage more people to enjoy new technology.
